                <h2>Buccaneers and Buffoonery</h2>
                <p class="intro-text">
                    A multiplayer pirate adventure game where each player commands their own ship, sails across an ocean map,
                    visits islands to gather resources, and upgrades their ship with new weapons and abilities.
                    Players can hop off their ships to explore islands on foot, collect loot, and compete (or cooperate) to become
                    the most powerful captain on the seas.

                <h2>Skills / Contribution</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Networking & Multiplayer Systems:</strong> Client-server architecture, synchronisation of ships, projectiles, and player inventories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle & Character Switching:</strong> Seamless control handover between a networked ship and on-foot player.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game State Management:</strong> Shared resource nodes, upgrade progression, and scoreboard synchronisation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gameplay Programming:</strong> Combat systems, upgrade mechanics, inventory/resource handling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Version control, task breakdown, modular system design.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By completing this project, I will meet job requirements in multiplayer gameplay programming,
                    network engineering, and game systems design, which are highly relevant in today’s industry.

                <h2>Industry Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    Multiplayer games are a cornerstone of the modern industry, from competitive shooters to co-op survival titles.
                    Demonstrating the ability to design, implement, and optimise networking features positions me strongly for roles in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gameplay Programmer</li>
                    <li>Network Engineer (Game-specific)</li>
                    <li>Multiplayer Systems Designer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This project showcases my ability to go beyond single-player mechanics and handle real-world technical challenges
                    in networked environments, which is a valuable differentiator.

                <ul>
                    <li>A working, playable prototype of <em>Buccaneers and Buffoonery</em></li>
                    <li>Playable demo build (2–4 players via LAN or online)</li>
                    <li>Documentation detailing networking structure, authority handling, and gameplay loop</li>
                    <li>Gameplay trailer/video showcase highlighting ship combat, island exploration, and upgrade systems</li>

                <h2>Showcasing / Publishing</h2>
                <p>
                    The final project will be showcased via:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A polished gameplay trailer highlighting ship combat, island exploration, and upgrade systems</li>
                    <li>A detailed project breakdown outlining development process, technical challenges (e.g., networking synchronisation, authority, ship-to-player switching), and solutions implemented</li>
                    <li>Upload to my personal portfolio website and <em>itch.io</em>, ensuring both professional presentation for recruiters and public accessibility for players</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Scoping</h2>
                <p>
                    If time becomes limited, the project will be scoped down as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MVP:</strong> Players control their own ships, sail around a shared map, and fire cannons at each other. Basic health/damage sync, respawning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next Priority:</strong> Add one island with resource nodes and the ability to hop off ships to gather resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extended Features:</strong> Multiple upgrade paths, multiple islands, AI enemies, advanced ship customisation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This ensures that even in the worst-case scenario, the project remains functional, playable,
                    and demonstrates the fundamental principles of networking.
